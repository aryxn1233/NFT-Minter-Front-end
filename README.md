NFT Minter Project This repository contains the code for an NFT Minter application, designed to allow users to mint their own Non-Fungible Tokens on a blockchain. This project demonstrates a full-stack approach to interacting with smart contracts and providing a user-friendly interface for digital asset creation.

üöÄ Project Overview This NFT Minter is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to connect their cryptocurrency wallet, specify details for their NFT (e.g., name, description, image URI), and then mint it directly to a blockchain. It's built with a focus on ease of use and showcasing the core functionalities of NFT creation.

‚ú® Features Wallet Connection: Seamless integration with popular Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask).

NFT Metadata Input: User interface for inputting NFT name, description, and image URI.

Smart Contract Interaction: Direct interaction with a deployed ERC-721 (or ERC-1155) smart contract for minting.

Transaction Status: Real-time feedback on transaction status (pending, confirmed, failed).

Token URI Generation (if applicable): Logic to handle IPFS or other decentralized storage for NFT metadata.

Responsive UI: Designed to be accessible and functional across various devices.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used Frontend React: For building the user interface.

Next.js (Optional, if used): For server-side rendering and static site generation.

Tailwind CSS / Styled Components / CSS Modules (Choose one/specify): For styling.

Web3.js / Ethers.js: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.

State Management (e.g., Redux, Zustand, React Context API): For managing application state.

Smart Contract Solidity: For writing the smart contract.

Hardhat / Truffle (Choose one/specify): For development, testing, and deployment of smart contracts.

OpenZeppelin Contracts: For secure and battle-tested ERC-721/ERC-1155 implementations.

Deployment & Tools IPFS / Arweave (Choose one/specify): For decentralized storage of NFT metadata and assets.

Alchemy / Infura (Choose one/specify): For blockchain node interaction.

Frontend Setup Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend # or wherever your React app lives

Install dependencies:

npm install # or yarn install

Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add the deployed smart contract address.

Example .env.local content for Next.js or .env for Create React App
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"

Add other necessary frontend env vars, e.g., IPFS gateway URL
Start the frontend development server:

npm start # or yarn start (for Create React App) npm run dev # or yarn dev (for Next.js)

The application should now be running in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.

üöÄ Usage Connect Wallet: Open the application in your browser and connect your Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the correct blockchain network.

Enter NFT Details: Fill in the fields for your NFT's Name, Description, and Image URI (e.g., an IPFS hash or a direct image URL).

Mint NFT: Click the "Mint" button. Your wallet will prompt you to confirm the transaction.

View Transaction: Once confirmed, you can view the transaction on a blockchain explorer (e.g., Etherscan for Ethereum, PolygonScan for Polygon).
‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

Prerequisites Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)

npm or yarn

A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) configured for the target network (e.g., Sepolia, Polygon Mumbai, local Hardhat network).

Backend (Smart Contract) Setup Clone the repository:

Install dependencies:

npm install # or yarn install

Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add your private key (for deployment) and API keys (e.g., Alchemy/Infura URL).

Example .env content
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_FOR_DEPLOYMENT" ALCHEMY_API_URL_SEPOLIA="YOUR_ALCHEMY_SEPOLIA_URL"

... other network URLs or keys
Compile the smart contract:

npx hardhat compile # or truffle compile

Deploy the smart contract:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia # or truffle migrate --network sepolia

Note down the deployed contract address.
