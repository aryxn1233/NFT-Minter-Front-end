      <p>
        This project, created by Aryan Thakur, is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows you to create unique NFTs using AI-powered image generation. You can either generate an image from a text prompt or upload your own image to mint as an NFT on the blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The front-end is built with React, and the back-end is powered by Flask. The smart contracts are written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
